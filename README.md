# 🐍 100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp

Welcome to my journey through the **100 Days of Code - Python Bootcamp** by Dr. Angela Yu! 🎯  
This repository contains all the coding exercises and mini-projects that I’ve completed as part of the course.

## What's Inside?

- **Daily Coding Exercises**  
  Practice problems and hands-on tasks from each lesson.

- **Mini Projects**  
  Fun and functional projects to apply what I've learned.

- **Final Projects**  
  Larger projects that combine skills from multiple days.

## 📌 Progress

I’m currently working my way through the course, updating this repository as I complete each day.  
Feel free to check back often to see my progress!
